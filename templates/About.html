        <p class="about-content">
            The idea for Game4U came from a cherished part of my childhood—playing on a popular website called <strong>Friv</strong>. Those memories of exploring and enjoying games inspired me to create a similar experience for today’s generation, where everyone can come together, play, and relive the fun. Just like the games I loved growing up, we aim to make your experience unforgettable.
        </p>
        <p class="about-content">
            Currently, we're using <strong>Pygame</strong> as our testing ground, but we have exciting plans for the future. As we grow, we’ll explore more advanced technologies to bring even better, more immersive games to the platform.
        </p>
        <p class="about-content">
